# Customer Churn Analysis

The project is a Customer chrun analysis simluation provided by Datacamp, with the purpose to demonstrate my ability of data analysis.
The final result is an overview dashboard showcasing who's churning, why they're churing, and the main reason behind those. 
There will be no actual proposal generated from this analysis as that's beyond the scope.
